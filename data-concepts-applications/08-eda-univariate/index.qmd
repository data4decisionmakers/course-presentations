## Outline

1. Continuous data/variable

     1.1 Numerical features
     1.2 Other features that should be checked

2. Categorical data/variable

     2.1 Nominal
     2.2 Ordinal

## Continuous data/variable

* Continuous data/variable is data that can take any numerical value. 

* Height, weight, temperature and length are all examples of continuous data.

## Numerical features of continuous data/variable

* Measure of **central tendency**

* Measure of **dispersion** (or variability/spread)

* Measure of **skewness** and **kurtosis**

## Other related features of continuous data/variable

* **Distribution** of continuous data/variable - can be _symmetric_ or _asymmetric_ or _multimodal_

* **Outliers** - some values that are far from the rest

* **Heaping** - some values occur unexpectedly often

* **Digit preference** - only certain values are found as there is a preference to round off to a specific value

* **Implausible** - values outside of plausible or likely range

## Measure of central tendency

* In statistics, measure of central tendency is a central or typical value for a probability distribution.

* Most common are **mean**, **median**, **mode** but there are many other measures of central tendency

* Not all measures of central tendency are **robust**

## Measure of central tendency - mean

$$ \text{mean/average} ~ = ~ \frac{\sum{\text{values}}}{n_\text{values}} $$

* **Mean** is a **non-robust** measure of location because it is susceptible/sensitive to a few extreme values in the data

::: {.notes}

**Mean**, or what some of us would call _average_, is the sum of all the values divided by the total number of values

:::

## Measure of central tendency - mean

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="30%"}

![](../../images/student_scores_01.png)

:::


::: {.column width="70%"}

* Consider this data of test scores of ten students.

* 8 out of the 10 students did really well with scores 75 and higher but two students got really low scores.

* Calculating the mean score across the 10 students:

```Excel
=AVERAGE(B2:B11)
```

```{r}
scores <- c(10, 15, 80, 90, 75, 85, 92, 90, 90, 90) 
```

we get **`r mean(scores)`**

:::

::::

## Measure of central tendency - median

* **Median** is the 50th quantile of the observations

* Median is a robust measure of central tendency because it is less influenced by extreme values.

* Calculating the median of the scores in the previous example:

```Excel
=MEDIAN(B2:B11)
```

we get **`r median(scores)`**


## Measure of central tendency - mean vs median

* The mean and the median can be very different from each other

* If `median > mean`, this would indicate that the continuous variable has some extremely low values

* If `median < mean`, this would indicate that the continuous variable has some extremely high values

* We should be using `median` instead of `mean` when performing summary measures for continuous variables

## Exercise {.center}

Using the student nutrition data in our exercises project, add median of age, weight, and height to the summary tables and compare with the mean values we got yesterday.

## Measure of dispersion

* describes the extent to which values of a continuous variable are spread out or scattered. 

* provides information about the data's variability or "spread" around a central value. 

* common measures of dispersion include _variance_, _standard deviation_, and _interquartile range (IQR)_.

## Measure of dispersion - standard deviation and variance

* most popular choice for measure of dispersion but are **not robust** to extreme values or outliers

<!-- $$ \text{standard deviation} ~ = ~ \sqrt{{\sum_{i = 1} ^ n} \frac{(x_i - \bar{x}) ^ 2}{n - 1}} $$ -->

* in Excel, you can calculate standard deviation using the `=STDEV()` function as follows (using the student scores example)

```Excel
=STDEV(B2:B11)
```

which gives **`r sd(scores)`**

## Measure of dispersion - interquartile range (IQR)

* IQR is the difference between 1st and 3rd quartile of the values of the continuous variable and is a more **robust** measure of spread.

* Excel doesn't have a function to calculate IQR but it can be calculated as follows (using the student scores example):

```Excel
=QUARTILE(B2:B11,3)-QUARTILE(B2:B11,1)
```

which gives **`r IQR(scores)`**

::: {.notes} 

The difference in the standard deviation and the IQR indicates how much the standard deviation is influenced by the two extremely low scores

## Boxplots

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

![](../../images/boxplot_muac.png)

:::

::: {.column width="60%"}

Boxplots or box-and-whisker plots are based on the following reduced summary of the data.

* **Median**
* **Hinges**: interquartile range
* **Inner fences:** the observation that is the most extreme, but within 1.5 x the length of the difference between the hinges.
* **Outer fences**: twice that of the inner fence.

## Exercise

* Plot box-and-whisker plot for the weight of the students by sex

* Plot box-and-whisker plot for the weight of the students by school

* Plot box-and-whisker plot for the weight of the students by region

## Histograms

* graphical representation of the distribution of numerical data. 

* It uses adjacent bars to show the frequency or count of data points within specified ranges, known as bins.

* Histograms provide insights into the data distribution, such as whether it is normally distributed (bell-shaped), skewed, or has multiple peaks (multimodal).

* They help identify patterns like clusters, gaps, and outliers in the data.

## Exercise

* Plot histogram for the height of the students by sex

* Plot histogram for the height of the students by school

* Plot histogram for the height of the students by region

## Quantile-quantile plot

* tests whether a continuous variable follows a particular theoretical distribution

* usually, we test whether our data is normally distributed, that is `mean = 0` and `standard deviation = 1`


## Quantile-Quantile plot - Step 1

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

![](../../images/qqplot_01.png)

:::

::: {.column width="60%"}

Sort/order the continuous variable in ascending order (lowest to highest) and give each row of the data a rank starting at 1.

```Excel
=SORT(B2:B11)
```

:::

## Quantile-Quantile plot - Step 2

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

![](../../images/qqplot_03.png)

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

Calculate the actual cumulative probability by substracting `0.5` from the rank and then divided by the total number of observations.

```Excel
=(C2 - 0.5)/10
```

## Quantile-Quantile plot - Step 3

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

![](../../images/qqplot_05.png)

:::

::: {.column width="40%"}

Calculate the theoretical cumulative probability using the `NORM.DIST()` function in Excel.

```Excel
=NORM.DIST(D2:D11,0,1,TRUE)
```
:::

## Quantile-Quantile plot - Step 4

* Calculate parameters for the QQ line.

* Calculate the 25th and 75th quantile of the continuous data.

```Excel
=QUARTILE(B2:B11,1)    ## 25th quantile
=QUARTILE(B2:B11,3)    ## 75th quantile
```

* Calculate the theoretical 25th and 75th quantile.

```Excel
=NORM.DIST(0.25,0,1,TRUE)    ## 25th quantile
=NORM.DIST(0.75,0,1,TRUE)    ## 75th quantile
```

## Quantile-Quantile plot - Step 4

* Calculate the slope and intercept of the QQ line

$$ \text{slope} ~ = ~ \frac{q3_{obs} - q1_{obs}}{q3_{theo} - q1_{theo}} $$
$$ \text{intercept} ~ = ~ q1_{obs} - slope \times q1_{theo} $$


## Quantile-Quantile plot - Step 5 {.center}

Create the plot.


## Digit preference

* Digit preference is the observation that the final number in a measurement occurs with a greater frequency than is expected by chance. 

* This can occur because of rounding, the practice of increasing or decreasing the value in a measurement to the nearest whole or half unit, or because data are made up.


## Digit preference - testing

* Extract the last digit of a continuous variable. You can do this in Excel using the `RIGHT()` function.

* Using pivot tables, create a summary table of the counts per last digit.
