## Outline

1. Contingency table

2. Risk ratio

3. Odds ratio

4. Comparing two groups

## The contingency table

* also known as a cross-tabulation

* used in statistics to display the relationship between two or more categorical variables

* organises data by showing the frequency of observations that fall into various combinations of the categories of the variables being examined.

* usually called a two-by-two table, contingency tables can be created with more than two categories per group.

## The contingency table

## Exercise {.center}

Creating contingency tables in Excel can be easily done using pivot tables. Let's try it with the `fem.xlsx` dataset.

## Risk ratio

* also called relative risk ratio (RRR)

* a measure of the risk of a certain event happening in one group (usually called the exposed group) compared to the risk of the same event happening in another group (usually called the unexposed group)

* it indicates how much more likely the outcome is in the exposed group compared to the unexposed group

## Risk ratio - understanding exposure

* because risk ratio was developed for disease epidemiology, the term exposure has been used which usually pertains to exposure to a risk factor or known causative agent of a particular disease outcome

* however, exposure in a general sense can also mean exposure to a factor or a condition that is known to be associated to a certain outcome which doesn't have to be a disease

* exposure to being female for an outcome of good grades; exposure to being married for an outcome of owning your house, etc.

$$ \text{risk ratio} ~ = ~ \frac{\frac{A}{A+B}}{\frac{C}{C+D}} ~ = ~ \frac{A \times (C+D)}{C \times {(A+B)}} $$

To get used to this formula, let's calculate RRR by hand using the example data on the left.

## Risk ratio - interpretation

**Risk ratio** | **Interpretation**
:--- | :---
`RR = 1` | Exposure does not affect outcome
`RR < 1` | Risk of outcome is decreased by the exposure (protective factor)
`RR > 1` | Risk of outcome is increased by the exposure (risk factor)

## Exercise {.center}

Now, let's try to calculate RRR using the `fem.xlsx`. Let's try to identify risk factors for **suicidal ideation (outcome)**. Let's test whether _non-normal sleep_, _no interest in sex_, _severe anxiety_, and/or _moderate to severe depression_ are risk factors to suicidal ideation.

## Odds ratio

* measure of association between an exposure and an outcome

* represents the odds that an outcome will occur given a particular exposure compared to the odds of the outcome occurring in the absence of the exposure

## Odds ratio - calculation

$$ \text{odds ratio} ~ = ~ \frac{\frac{A}{B}}{\frac{C}{D}} ~ = ~ \frac{A \times D}{B \times C} $$

To get used to this formula, let's calculate OR by hand using the example data on the left.

## Odds ratio - interpretation

**Odds ratio** | **Interpretation**
:--- | :---
`OR = 1` | Exposure does not affect odds of outcome
`OR > 1` | Exposure associated with higher odds of outcome
`OR < 1` | Exposure associated with lower odds of outcome

## Exercise {.center}

Now, let's try to calculate OR using the `fem.xlsx`. Let's try to identify risk factors for **suicidal ideation (outcome)**. Let's test whether _non-normal sleep_, _no interest in sex_, _severe anxiety_, and/or _moderate to severe depression_ are risk factors to suicidal ideation.


## Difference between risk ratio and odds ratio

* RR approximates OR for outcomes that are rare (< 10%) and as such can be reported interchangeably

* In non-rare outcomes, OR will tend to have greater magnitude than RR but always in the same direction (negative or positive)

* In specific study designs, the total population-at-risk is not known hence RR cannot be calculated
