## Outline

* Data sources

* Data formats

* Data types

* Data structures

* Data systems


## Data source {.center}

A data source is the origin of data, the location where information is stored and can be accessed for use. It can be anything from a database, a spreadsheet, a file, or even a live data feed.

::: {.notes}

This is a generic definition/description. Variations of this definition are usually dictated by what the data is for. For example...

## Data source: research {.center}

In research, data sources are the places where information is obtained. They can be anything from **original data** collected through _experiments_ or _surveys_ to **existing data** from _books_, _articles_, or _online databases_.

## Data source: Primary vs Secondary

* **Primary** - These are the original sources of information, often collected firsthand by the researcher. Examples include surveys, interviews, observations, and experiments.

* **Secondary** - These are sources that are based on or derived from primary sources. They can include books, articles, reports, and online databases.

## Examples of data sources {.center}

Exercise: Think about your current role in relation to the data that you work on and list out **ALL** your sources of data.

## Data format {.center}

Data formats are **methods to encode** data that adhere to generally accepted specifications or standards.

These methods to encode are standardized set of rules that determine how data is stored, organized, and transmitted.

::: {.notes}

Highly technical definition; key idea here is how format is an approach or method of encoding data. As such, it is more of a concept rather than a physical entity (i.e., a file). 

A data format is the standardized set of rules that determine how data is stored, organized, and transmitted.

## Data format: importance

* The data format usually provides us with an indication of whether or not two sets of data are interoperable.

* General rule is that data of the same format usually means they can be handled and used with the same tools and with the same techniques.

* This is because they follow the same rules and methods to encode data.

## Data type

* Define the kind of data a variable or object can store and the operations that can be performed on it. They are fundamental building blocks in programming and data analysis. 


* Refers to the set of data representations in use by a particular processor (usually a computer), which all compiled computer programs must use.

## Data type: importance

* Data type gives us an indication of what kinds of techniques and/or functions and/or operations we can apply to the data

* Data types also enforce a delineation between different kinds of data that prevents two incompatible types to be grouped together

## Data type: most basic/common

* Numeric types
    * integers
    * floats

* text types - strings

* boolean values

## Data structure {.center}

Data structure is a data organisation and storage method or technique that is usually chosen for efficient access to data. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

## Data system

Data systems involve platforms that manage and store data effectively such as **databases** (relational or non-relational), **data lakes** holding large volumes, **big data systems** for massive datasets, and **business intelligence tools** for analytics.
